## User experience

This website is focused on the users that have a special passion for luxury watches and for sure the collectors. Once the website is loaded,
you will be asked to sign up in order to see all the watches that are for sale. 

### User Goals:

As a User I would like to have a simple UX that is self explantory and at the same time efficient enough to do what I'm expecting from it, 
Like loading the pages easily and the checkout experience is easy to handle. 

### Developer Goals:

As a developer I want to showcase what I'm capable of and also make the journey through my page from the sign up and all the way up to the checkout
as smooth as possible. At the same time make it unforgettable for the shopper.
