## User experience

This website is focused on the users that have a special passion for luxury watches and for sure the collectors. Once the website is loaded,
you will be asked to sign up in order to see all the watches that are for sale. 

### User Goals:

As a User I would like to have a simple UX that is self explantory and at the same time efficient enough to do what I'm expecting from it, 
Like loading the pages easily and the checkout experience is easy to handle. 

### Developer Goals:

As a developer I want to showcase what I'm capable of and also make the journey through my page from the sign up and all the way up to the checkout
as smooth as possible. At the same time make it unforgettable for the shopper.

## Features

In this section we will be talking about the different technologies that I implemented in this project and the features that could be implemented
as well: 

### Existing Features

* **Sign up:** This is the first step that a user would be able to do in order to get through to the page and be able to see what kind of
watches we have.

* **Adding an item to the cart:** This will add the item that you would like to purchase to the cart by providing the quantity.

* **Checkout:** The Checkout button will bring you to the *checkout page* where you fill in your personal & credit card data and place 
the purchase.

### Left to be implemented:

* **My account page:** Where you see your personal information and also see all orders that were made.


## Technologies Used

In this project I have used several technologies in order to achieve my end goal, here are the techs I used:

* **Python3:** This is the language used to build this project from scratch. 
* **Html:** Html to build the templates.
* **Django:** Django frameworks to create an interactive ecommerece page.
* **CSS:** To custom style the page and add some unique touch to my styles.
* **Bootstrap:** For styling the page and using the bootstrap **Navbar**.
* **Jquery:** To implement Stripe payments.
* **Font-awesome:** For adding different icons.
* **Google-Fonts:** To add new fonts. 

## Testing

I have conducted multiple tests in order to check the app on feasbility and also on durability. The app is not to be broken by loading. 

I tested also the login links and the registration and if the user is saved correctly in order to access the page and the watches. 

I also asked Family members and collagues at work to go through the website and test it on functionality and they were impressed by its performance and they added some recipes themselves.

## Deployment

The project is pushed to Github from there it was linked to Heroku for deployment.
